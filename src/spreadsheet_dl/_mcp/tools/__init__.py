"""
MCP tool handlers organized by category.

PLACEHOLDER: Tool handlers will be fully modularized in a future phase.

For now, all tool handlers remain as methods within the MCPServer class
in server.py. This package structure is prepared for future extraction
of individual tool categories into separate modules.

Planned structure:
    - budget.py: Budget analysis tools
    - cell.py: Cell manipulation tools
    - style.py: Style and formatting tools
    - structure.py: Row/column/sheet structure tools
    - chart.py: Chart creation tools
    - advanced.py: Advanced features (validation, workbook ops, data import/export)
